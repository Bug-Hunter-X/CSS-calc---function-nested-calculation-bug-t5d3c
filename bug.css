The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when using nested calculations. For example, the following code will not render correctly:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(calc(50% - 10px) - 20px);
}
```

This is because the nested `calc()` functions are not being evaluated correctly. The correct way to write this code is:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px - 20px);
}
```
