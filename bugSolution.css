The solution is to simplify the nested `calc()` expression into a single `calc()` expression.  The browser can then correctly evaluate the entire expression in one step. 

The corrected CSS code is:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 30px);
}
```

This will correctly calculate the width of the element.
